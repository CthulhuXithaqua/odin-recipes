# odin-recipes
It may be a simple and ugly recipe website at first, but i plan on polishing it as much as i can while learning
todo:
1- html index plus a few pages
2- write some cool recipes
3- add some images, colours and fonts
4- add some more css to make it more viewable
5- start adding some javascript
6- have fun :)
